## Requirements
- Linux or Windows OS
- C3 compiler (c3c)
## Instalation
All the necessary steps in order to download the C3 compiler can be found on the official website: [Install C3 Compiler](https://c3-lang.org/getting-started/prebuilt-binaries/)
## Compiling a program
1. Open a terminal and navigate to the PacMan
```bash
cd PacMan
```
2. Run the following commands to build the program:
```bash
c3c build
c3c run
```
3. If the window is too big or too small for you, navigate to the subdirectory and open a file called main.c3. There you will find a variable called screen scale, which you can change to your personal preference:
```bash
# Your prefered scale value, e.g. 4
const SCREEN_SCALE = 4;
```
## How to play
- Start the game by pressing **space bar**
- Move using **WASD**
- Collect all **244 dots** to advance to the next level
- The game ends when **PacMan loses all his lives**
- Press the **left arrow key** to **decrease** the volume and the **right arrow key** to **increase** it
## Missing features
- Frighten ghost **blink** continuously instead of only when the timer is almost over
- **Pac-Ma**n becomes **unresponsive (canâ€™t turn or react)** after a **ghost dies**
- **Ghost music** lacking proper **update functionality**
